# TemperatureSensor
A HomeKit temperature sensor for https://github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266 using a Dallas DS18B20 1-wire temperature probe

This is directly copied from Mixiaoxiao's temperature sensor example. It's dead simple to just add the applicable library for your sensor and then add the line or two at most required to read it.
